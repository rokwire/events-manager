This concert begins with the Brahms Haydn Variations, a set of movements based on a 10-measure theme by Haydn uniquely divided into two five-bar phrases. This work features each orchestral section and closes with a masterful restatement of the chorale. Bruch&rsquo;s Concerto in G Minor is among his most popular works with its dark and tuneful themes giving way to a dancing and fiery finish. Following intermission, Sinfonia will accompany the winner of its annual youth concerto competition before closing the concert with Mendelssohn&rsquo;s richly Romantic &ldquo;Scottish&rdquo; symphony. Inspired by the composer&rsquo;s trip to Britain and tour of Scotland, the work shifts from a stormy first movement to a rousing finale that includes a victory hymn.\n&nbsp;\nBrahms: Variations on a Theme by Haydn, Op. 56Bruch: Violin Concerto&nbsp;No. 1 in&nbsp;G Minor, Op. 262019 Youth Concerto Competition Winner, TBAMendelssohn: Symphony&nbsp;No. 3 in A Minor, Op. 56, \"Scottish\"\n\n\n\n\n",

		"description": "Drag queen Sasha Velour burst onto the national scene as the stunning season nine champion of the Emmy Award-winning program RuPaul&rsquo;s Drag Race. Success followed as celebs swarmed her hit drag show Nightgowns, and her producer and director credentials, popular publications, and social media following continued to grow. But before all that, she was already beloved right here in Champaign-Urbana where her father teaches at the university and a young Sasha made her drag debut at C-Street. Smoke &amp; Mirrors, Velour&rsquo;s first one-queen show, is an effortless blend of drag, visual art, and magic. Velour introduces audiences to a whole new side of her artistry through 13 dazzling and genre-busting lip-synch performances, all directed and choreographed by the queen herself. You&rsquo;ll be on the edge of your seat as she explodes into rose petals, vanishes in a poof of smoke, saws herself in half, conjures a rainstorm, even transforms into a tree in front of your eyes (to name just a few). But the real magic is the way that these illusions and deceptions serve to unmask deeper truths,&nbsp;sparking fresh analysis of gender, fame, family, and the importance of dreaming big and living life over-the-top.\n&nbsp;\nVelour&rsquo;s visit, a CAS/MillerComm2020 series event, is part of the University of Illinois campuswide celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots and the beginning of the LGBTQ community civil rights movement, and the Spurlock Museum&rsquo;s exhibit of drag costumes entitled Transformations: From Ordinary to Extraordinary, Costume Art in the Contemporary Drag, which opens on Saturday, September 14.\n&nbsp;\nPresented by Krannert Center for the Performing Arts in collaboration with Center for Advanced Study, College of Fine and Applied Arts, Illinois Theatre, Spurlock Museum, Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities, Lorado Taft Fund, Siebel Center for Design, and the Russian, East European, and Eurasian Center.\n",

		"description": "\n\n\n\nThe King&rsquo;s Singers were established in May 1968&mdash;one year before the doors of Krannert Center opened&mdash;by six recently graduated choral scholars from King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, England. The world may have changed a lot in the 50 years since the original King&rsquo;s Singers came together, but today&rsquo;s group is still charged by the same driving force&mdash;to radiate every day the joy singing brings and to share that excitement with audiences through virtuosity and vision. The King&rsquo;s Singers&rsquo; musical craft, combined with their unique charm and their celebration of great music in all its diversity, has captured hearts worldwide&mdash;two Grammy Awards, an Emmy Award, and a place in Gramophone&rsquo;s Hall of Fame testify to that accomplishment. The ensemble&rsquo;s Krannert Center program, Finding Harmony, expresses the idea that singing is a language that can be spoken by anyone, and that uniting voices in harmony creates something greater and more beautiful than the sum of its parts. The a cappella performance will contain a delightful range of music, from medieval chant to pop hits, from newly commissioned works to jazz standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n",

		"description": "&ldquo;There is something, way down deep that&rsquo;s eternal about every human being . . . And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s left when memory is gone.&rdquo; &mdash;Thornton Wilder\n&nbsp;\nWhere art and science meet, Theatre Re&rsquo;s The Nature of Forgetting bursts forth with creativity, joy, and heartache. Neuroscientist Kate Jeffery collaborated with director Guillaume Pig&eacute; for this London company&rsquo;s moving exploration of the countless dimensions of memory and amnesia, linking science with real-life experiences in a captivating style that embraces mime, theatre, and live music. The Nature of Forgetting is the story of Tom, a middle-aged father who is struggling in the early stages of dementia. A life-affirming journey into a weakened mind as well as a shining celebration of memory and a life well lived, this &ldquo;breathakingly beautiful&rdquo; piece shows us that broken or changed doesn&rsquo;t have to mean defeated (The List, Edinburgh).\n&nbsp;\nThis performance will be presented in 75 minutes without intermission.\n&nbsp;\nCo-commissioned by the London International Mime Festival, The Point Eastleigh, and South Hill Park Arts Centre. Funded by National Lottery through Arts Council England. Supported by Shoreditch Town Hall, Lincoln Drill Hall, Jacksons Lane and Haringey Council.\n",

		"description": "This exhibition features works from KAM&rsquo;s collection of exquisite paintings predominantly from Rajasthan and the Punjab hills, in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of these works were commissioned by royals of the Rajput or Hindu, princely courts that came under the suzerainty of the Mughal Empire between the late1500s and 1800s. Their enthusiastic arts patronage led to the flourishing of a wide range of regional painting styles and subjects. Especially prevalent are images drawn from the great Hindu epics in which stories of love, longing, and devotion are recounted through the deeds of Hindu deities and their avatars on earth.\nAlso popular and showing the centuries-long comingling of Rajput and Mughal artistic preferences, are depictions of court life and aristocratic portraiture. The exhibition also features a selection of richly illustrated, devotional narratives commissioned by patrons as acts of piety, and to accrue divine merit for the next life.\nWhile local Indian painters had been producing illustrated texts on horizontal palm leaves for Jain, Buddhist, and Hindu devotees from as early as 1000 CE, the introduction of papermaking from central Asia via the expansion of the Mughal empire freed artists to work in larger, vertical page formats.\nHowever, Rajput paintings were not bound or displayed on walls. They were held close to the body, to be viewed intimately, one at a time, then shared with companions by being passed from hand to hand. Many were also passed on to friends and allies and traveled long distances as precious gifts. Devotional paintings were also created for pilgrims at temple sites who carried them on their journeys home. Others were used as visual aids in itinerant storytelling, or for prayer and recitation. Many artists were themselves itinerant, working in different court ateliers over their careers. Another kind of &ldquo;mobility&rdquo; is found in the almost synesthetic blending of musical, literary, and visual metaphor that animate the images themselves.\nFrom Hand to Hand&nbsp;explores the performative dimensions of these evocative paintings. The exhibition&rsquo;s related programming asks more broadly how these works narrate themselves into the contemporary politics of place and identity in South Asia today. KAM&rsquo;s collection of Indian paintings was built through the generous donations of distinguished collectors George P. Bickford, Alvin O. Bellak, and Rachel and Allen S. Weller, between 1965 and 2003. A selection of these works was recently conserved through a grant from the E. Rhodes and Leona B. Carpenter Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurated by Allyson Purpura, senior curator and curator of Global African Art, with research assistance from curatorial interns Yutong Shi and Samit Sinha.\nKrannert Art Museum acknowledges and thanks University of Illinois faculty Jessica Vantine Birkenholtz, Assistant Professor in the Department of Religion; Rini Bhattacharya Mehta, Assistant Professor in the Department of Comparative World Literatures; Hans Hock, Professor Emeritus in the Department of Linguistics; and Dede Fairchild Ruggles, Professor and Chair of the Department of Landscape Architecture; as well as Krista Gulbransen, Assistant Professor of Art History at Whitman College, for their generous consultation in the preparation of this exhibition.\n\n\n\n\n",

The painting, away from view for some time, has undergone a major conservation treatment, and is now ready to be featured in this new installation, alongside well-known portraits by John Singleton Copley, Moretto da Brescia, and Thomas Gainsborough.

		"startDate": "2019-05-10T08:30:00",
		"endDate": "2019-05-10T23:59:00",
		"description": "Mad Creative was organized by the Initiative in Holocaust, Genocide, and Memory Studies and the YMCA, The Women&rsquo;s Resources Center, APO-AA, Women &amp; Gender in Global Perspectives, and independent artists and thinkers. With generous sponsorship from the School of Literatures, Cultures, and Linguistics, the Department of English, Gender and Women&rsquo;s Studies, and Center for Advanced Study.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThe exhibit is on view during museum open hours.\n&nbsp;\nMore about Mad Creative from Brett Ashley Kaplan, Director, Initiative in Holocaust, Genocide, Memory Studies, and Professor, Comparative and World Literatures:\n&nbsp;\n\nThe series that has become &ldquo;Mad Creative&rdquo; is the first in what I hope will become a Holocaust, Genocide, Memory Studies (HGMS) annual tradition. It generated through a perhaps atypical origin story. I saw on Facebook a posting from one of the wonderful Comparative and World Literature and now HGMS graduate students, Meagan Smith. I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Meagan&rsquo;s writing ever since her exams some years ago and I read her post during a time when I felt bombarded, teary, and triggered by the enormity of sexual violence in the news. Here is part of what Meagan posted: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve listened to people assume&hellip;that women who do speak up are likely to be lying, and arguing that women should remove themselves from work places and social spaces that &lsquo;make them uncomfortable&rsquo; while the men creating the atmosphere of discomfort should be given all the space they want for their toxic behavior. I've responded with logic, with questions, with outrage, with personal narratives, with frustrated pleas to simply acknowledge that the systemic roots of the problem should be addressed. So, before totally missing the point and frantically deploying the &lsquo;not all men&rsquo; argument, please take a deep breath and listen to the women you care about. Be brave and try deferring to us on these issues. Leave your fear and your guilt and your own discomfort behind long enough to allow us a chance to catch our breath and change the damn world. We will do the rest of the work it takes to gain our share of the freedom you take for granted.&rdquo;\nA few days after her post, Meagan and I met to discuss how to do something about this sense of bombardment and the feeling of being silenced. Meagan suggested we reach out to various groups across campus and we did. Through a series of planning meetings with a range of people from The Women&rsquo;s Resources Center, YWCA, APO, Women &amp; Gender in Global Perspectives, as well independent artists and thinkers, we decided to orchestrate a three-part series: A Breathing Room; a rally to celebrate the almost 100 years since women gained the right to vote and Breaking the Silence: A Mosaic Project led by the artist Susan Parenti. We felt that this range of events would speak to the range of feelings we had&mdash;we wanted to talk, to listen, to shout, to break something and also to make something.\nHGMS has focused until now on trauma and memory studies and has done incredible work to educate students, the community, and faculty about the Armenian genocide, about the interconnections between traumas across temporal and geographical divides. Some of our speakers have been experts in gender studies. But we had not until Mad Creative organized an event expressly around gender and trauma. We held our Breathing Room in the Lucy Ellis lounge and not only was every seat full, but people were standing at the back of the room and huge numbers of people thanked us for putting this together. It felt very needed and very, very appreciated. We gathered to talk and to listen. And to find ways to end rape culture and begin consent culture or whatever else we can call a world without rampant sexual harassment of women, transpeople, men, boys, girls; everyone should be able to breathe! After the panel had spoken, we all broke into discussion groups and talked and then re-convened for a final conversation. In my group we first discussed transitional justice and then branched out to tell stories and share ideas and feelings. The evening concluded with everyone screaming. That unexpected group expression was just right.\nThe Mosaics you see here are the glorious result of the final event in the Mad Creative Series. Susan Parenti of School for Designing a Society led us through the process of smashing and then making mosaics. Many of the mosaics were made collectively and the artists were students, community members, faculty&mdash;Breaking the Silence was open to all. The Mosaics had no given theme so each person or group choose to break and make in whatever way worked for them. We hope to be able to offer more community and collective artistic projects in future and we are so grateful to the Spurlock and to its director, Elizabeth Sutton, and everyone who helped put this exhibit in place!\nThe organizing group of the whole series turned out to be an intensely smart and creative crowd (hence the collective Mad Creative) and I offer an enormous thanks to Meagan Smith, Naomi Taub, Sarah Colom&eacute;, Nidhi Singh, Alaina Pincus, Michelle Awad, Lesley Wexler, Anita Kaiser, Susan Parenti, Dilara Caliskan, Claire Baytas, and Ronnie Hemrich.\n\nFor more information about HGMS please visit these sites: https://jewishculture.illinois.edu/academics/initiative-holocaust-genocide-and-memory-studies\nhttps://hgmsblog.weebly.com/\n&nbsp;\n",

		"description": "This exhibition features works from KAM&rsquo;s collection of exquisite paintings predominantly from Rajasthan and the Punjab hills, in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of these works were commissioned by royals of the Rajput or Hindu, princely courts that came under the suzerainty of the Mughal Empire between the late1500s and 1800s. Their enthusiastic arts patronage led to the flourishing of a wide range of regional painting styles and subjects. Especially prevalent are images drawn from the great Hindu epics in which stories of love, longing, and devotion are recounted through the deeds of Hindu deities and their avatars on earth.\nAlso popular and showing the centuries-long comingling of Rajput and Mughal artistic preferences, are depictions of court life and aristocratic portraiture. The exhibition also features a selection of richly illustrated, devotional narratives commissioned by patrons as acts of piety, and to accrue divine merit for the next life.\nWhile local Indian painters had been producing illustrated texts on horizontal palm leaves for Jain, Buddhist, and Hindu devotees from as early as 1000 CE, the introduction of papermaking from central Asia via the expansion of the Mughal empire freed artists to work in larger, vertical page formats.\nHowever, Rajput paintings were not bound or displayed on walls. They were held close to the body, to be viewed intimately, one at a time, then shared with companions by being passed from hand to hand. Many were also passed on to friends and allies and traveled long distances as precious gifts. Devotional paintings were also created for pilgrims at temple sites who carried them on their journeys home. Others were used as visual aids in itinerant storytelling, or for prayer and recitation. Many artists were themselves itinerant, working in different court ateliers over their careers. Another kind of &ldquo;mobility&rdquo; is found in the almost synesthetic blending of musical, literary, and visual metaphor that animate the images themselves.\nFrom Hand to Hand&nbsp;explores the performative dimensions of these evocative paintings. The exhibition&rsquo;s related programming asks more broadly how these works narrate themselves into the contemporary politics of place and identity in South Asia today. KAM&rsquo;s collection of Indian paintings was built through the generous donations of distinguished collectors George P. Bickford, Alvin O. Bellak, and Rachel and Allen S. Weller, between 1965 and 2003. A selection of these works was recently conserved through a grant from the E. Rhodes and Leona B. Carpenter Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurated by Allyson Purpura, senior curator and curator of Global African Art, with research assistance from curatorial interns Yutong Shi and Samit Sinha.\nKrannert Art Museum acknowledges and thanks University of Illinois faculty Jessica Vantine Birkenholtz, Assistant Professor in the Department of Religion; Rini Bhattacharya Mehta, Assistant Professor in the Department of Comparative World Literatures; Hans Hock, Professor Emeritus in the Department of Linguistics; and Dede Fairchild Ruggles, Professor and Chair of the Department of Landscape Architecture; as well as Krista Gulbransen, Assistant Professor of Art History at Whitman College, for their generous consultation in the preparation of this exhibition.\n\n\n\n\n",

With generous sponsorship from the School of Literatures, Cultures, and Linguistics, the Department of English, Gender and Women&rsquo;s Studies, and Center for Advanced Study.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThe exhibit is on view during museum open hours.\n&nbsp;\nMore about Mad Creative from Brett Ashley Kaplan, Director, Initiative in Holocaust, Genocide, Memory Studies, and Professor, Comparative and World Literatures:\n&nbsp;\n\nThe series that has become &ldquo;Mad Creative&rdquo; is the first in what I hope will become a Holocaust, Genocide, Memory Studies (HGMS) annual tradition. It generated through a perhaps atypical origin story. I saw on Facebook a posting from one of the wonderful Comparative and World Literature and now HGMS graduate students, Meagan Smith. I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Meagan&rsquo;s writing ever since her exams some years ago and I read her post during a time when I felt bombarded, teary, and triggered by the enormity of sexual violence in the news. Here is part of what Meagan posted: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve listened to people assume&hellip;that women who do speak up are likely to be lying, and arguing that women should remove themselves from work places and social spaces that &lsquo;make them uncomfortable&rsquo; while the men creating the atmosphere of discomfort should be given all the space they want for their toxic behavior. I've responded with logic, with questions, with outrage, with personal narratives, with frustrated pleas to simply acknowledge that the systemic roots of the problem should be addressed. So, before totally missing the point and frantically deploying the &lsquo;not all men&rsquo; argument, please take a deep breath and listen to the women you care about. Be brave and try deferring to us on these issues. Leave your fear and your guilt and your own discomfort behind long enough to allow us a chance to catch our breath and change the damn world. We will do the rest of the work it takes to gain our share of the freedom you take for granted.&rdquo;\nA few days after her post, Meagan and I met to discuss how to do something about this sense of bombardment and the feeling of being silenced. Meagan suggested we reach out to various groups across campus and we did. Through a series of planning meetings with a range of people from The Women&rsquo;s Resources Center, YWCA, APO, Women &amp; Gender in Global Perspectives, as well independent artists and thinkers, we decided to orchestrate a three-part series: A Breathing Room; a rally to celebrate the almost 100 years since women gained the right to vote and Breaking the Silence: A Mosaic Project led by the artist Susan Parenti. We felt that this range of events would speak to the range of feelings we had&mdash;we wanted to talk, to listen, to shout, to break something and also to make something.\nHGMS has focused until now on trauma and memory studies and has done incredible work to educate students, the community, and faculty about the Armenian genocide, about the interconnections between traumas across temporal and geographical divides. Some of our speakers have been experts in gender studies. But we had not until Mad Creative organized an event expressly around gender and trauma. We held our Breathing Room in the Lucy Ellis lounge and not only was every seat full, but people were standing at the back of the room and huge numbers of people thanked us for putting this together. It felt very needed and very, very appreciated. We gathered to talk and to listen. And to find ways to end rape culture and begin consent culture or whatever else we can call a world without rampant sexual harassment of women, transpeople, men, boys, girls; everyone should be able to breathe! After the panel had spoken, we all broke into discussion groups and talked and then re-convened for a final conversation. In my group we first discussed transitional justice and then branched out to tell stories and share ideas and feelings. The evening concluded with everyone screaming. That unexpected group expression was just right.\nThe Mosaics you see here are the glorious result of the final event in the Mad Creative Series. Susan Parenti of School for Designing a Society led us through the process of smashing and then making mosaics. Many of the mosaics were made collectively and the artists were students, community members, faculty&mdash;Breaking the Silence was open to all. The Mosaics had no given theme so each person or group choose to break and make in whatever way worked for them. We hope to be able to offer more community and collective artistic projects in future and we are so grateful to the Spurlock and to its director, Elizabeth Sutton, and everyone who helped put this exhibit in place!\nThe organizing group of the whole series turned out to be an intensely smart and creative crowd (hence the collective Mad Creative) and I offer an enormous thanks to Meagan Smith, Naomi Taub, Sarah Colom&eacute;, Nidhi Singh, Alaina Pincus, Michelle Awad, Lesley Wexler, Anita Kaiser, Susan Parenti, Dilara Caliskan, Claire Baytas, and Ronnie Hemrich.\n\nFor more information about HGMS please visit these sites: https://jewishculture.illinois.edu/academics/initiative-holocaust-genocide-and-memory-studies\nhttps://hgmsblog.weebly.com/\n&nbsp;\n",

Cyclists will take to the roads in a silent procession to honor cyclists who have been killed or injured while cycling on public roadways. Although cyclists have a legal right to share the road with motorists, the motoring public often isn't aware of these rights, and sometimes not aware of the cyclists themselves.\n&nbsp;\nIn 2003,Chris Phelan organized the first Ride of Silence in Dallas after endurance cyclist Larry Schwartz was hit by the mirror of a passing bus and was killed. (Read the full history here...)\n&nbsp;\nThe Ride of Silence is a free ride that asks its cyclists to ride no faster than 12 mph, wear helmets, follow the rules of the road and remain silent during the ride. There are no registration fees. &nbsp;The ride, which is held during National Bike Month, aims to raise the awareness of motorists, police and city officials that cyclists have a legal right to the public roadways. The ride is also a chance to show respect for and honor the lives of those who have been killed or injured.\nPlease check the resources on this site. If there is a Ride of Silence in your area, we encourage you to join them. If there is not a ride planned in your area, please consider adding your city to the ever-growing list of sites. To get information on how to organize and host a Ride of Silence, please click here; you might also want to look at our FAQ.\nThe necessary expenses the Ride of Silence has to incur are met by supportive volunteers and donations\n",

		"description": "&ldquo;[M]any a man that drove a tractor on the plains of Alberta and Saskatchewan two years ago is but a bundle of bones on a battle field of France,&rdquo; warned Eugene Davenport, University of Illinois&rsquo; Dean of Agriculture, in the&nbsp;Saturday Evening Post&nbsp;a month after the United States entered World War I. Davenport and other agricultural leaders called on citizens to take up farm work to ensure famine would not take hold in North America or Europe. To replace Canadian farmers serving in Europe, Davenport called on UIUC&rsquo;s student body. In April 1917, the University of Illinois allowed 228 students to depart for farms across the Canadian Prairie. For men too young to serve in the military, it was a welcome opportunity to demonstrate their patriotism and do their part for the war effort. This talk reveals the untold story of the transnational efforts the University and its students went to support the war effort in 1917.\n&nbsp;\nPresenter Nathan Tye is a doctoral candidate in history at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His dissertation, The Ways of the Hobo: Transient Mobility and Culture in the United States, 1870s-1930s, explores the history of mobility and its intersections with gender, sexuality, class, and race within the lives of transient and casual laborers, better known as hobos, in the United States. Tye serves as the Associate Editor of the SourceLab digital publishing collective and as Assistant Book Review Editor of Middle West Review, published by the University of Nebraska Press. He graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in History and Theology from Creighton University in 2011.\n",

Learn the history behind this art, and enjoy a bowl of matcha tea and a traditional sweet. Experience a moment of peace.\nReservations are required. You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you, and you still still be at the same height as the other participants.\n",
