		"description": "Join us for a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan, and is at the very heart of Japan House. Learn the history behind this art, and enjoy a bowl of matcha tea and a traditional sweet. Experience a moment of peace.\nReservations are required. You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you, and you still still be at the same height as the other participants.\n",
